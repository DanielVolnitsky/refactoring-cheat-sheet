## Extract Method
https://refactoring.com/catalog/extractMethod.html

- Helps provide clarity of purpose for the enclosed statements
- Removes the need for comments when using expressive method names
- Consider using even over short pieces of code that are semantically dense
- Consider using if inside the method the statements deal with different [layers of abstraction](http://principles-wiki.net/principles:single_level_of_abstraction)
- Don't use if the extracted piece of code cannot be given a better name than the current method's

## Inline Method
https://refactoring.com/catalog/inlineMethod.html

- Helps with needless indirection
- Consider using as an intermediate step to cleaning up badly factored, smaller methods
- Don't use if a subclass overrides the method

## Inline Temp
https://refactoring.com/catalog/inlineTemp.html

- Only use when assigning the value of a method call
- Consider using as an intermediate step when refactoring to a [Replace Temp with Query](##replace-temp-with-query)

## Replace Temp with Query
https://refactoring.com/catalog/replaceTempWithQuery.html

- Helps reduce method size by extracting a commonly used query
- Consider using if a given expression is used only once within the method
- Consider using if the temp variable is only assigned to once within the method

## Introduce Explaining Variable
https://refactoring.com/catalog/extractVariable.html

- Helps with expressiveness of conditional statements
- Consider using if many conditionals are being considered
- Consider using [Extract Method](##extract-method) for the conditional statement if it is a recurring check instead
- Often leads to [Replace Temp With Query](##replace-temp-with-query)


## Split Temporary Variable
https://refactoring.com/catalog/splitTemporaryVariable.html

- Consider using if you are re-using a temp variable
- Helps refactor code to follow [Single Responsibility Principle](http://principles-wiki.net/principles:single_responsibility_principle)
- Can likely be identified if the name of the variable does not express what it's used for in a meaningful way (temp, foo, etc.)
